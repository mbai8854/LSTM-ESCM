# LSTM-ESCM
This is the program for the paper "LSTM-Assisted Evolutionary Self-Expressive Subspace Clustering"
Here the main programs demonstrate an example of our proposed LSTM-ESCM on the Hopkins155 dataset. This dataset can be found at http://www.vision.jhu.edu/data/hopkins155/.

For the plotting of the mean errors and their 95% confidence interval, we refer users to apply the "stdshade" function which can be found at https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29534-stdshade.
